## What is OlliteRT?

**Think of it as [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for Android.** Pick a model, tap Start, and your phone becomes an LLM server — runs LLMs on your mobile GPU/CPU via Google's [LiteRT-LM](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM) runtime and serves them as a standard [OpenAI-compatible HTTP API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) on your local network.

**No cloud. No API keys. No subscriptions. Just your phone.**

## Features
- **Multi-model Support** — One-tap download from HuggingFace, import `.litertlm` files or model lists from local storage, or add custom model sources via JSON file or URL
- **Multimodal & Reasoning** — Vision, audio, thinking, streaming support, and tool calling (experimental) for capable models
- **Benchmark Built-in** — Test and compare models on your device to find the best fit for your hardware
- **Activity Logs** — Detailed request/response logs with search, filtering, and JSON highlighting
- **Always On, Low Power** — Configurable auto-start on boot, sips ~5-10W vs 300W+ for a GPU server — perfect for that old phone in your drawer*
- **Highly Configurable** — Per-model inference settings, GPU/CPU accelerator, idle model unload, bearer token auth, and more
- **Model & Server Monitoring** — Live stats dashboard, [Prometheus metrics](docs/integrations/PROMETHEUS.md) for Grafana, and [Home Assistant REST API](docs/integrations/HOME_ASSISTANT.md) for remote server control
- **Broad Compatibility** — Home Assistant, Open WebUI, OpenClaw, Python, curl — if it talks to OpenAI, it works

> [!NOTE]
> Home Assistant currently requires a custom integration such as [Extended OpenAI Conversation](https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation) or [Local OpenAI LLM](https://github.com/skye-harris/hass_local_openai_llm) and [OpenAI STT](https://github.com/NightMean/OpenAI_STT_HASS) for voice commands — see the [Home Assistant client setup](docs/CLIENT_SETUP.md#home-assistant)

## Quick Start

1. **Download & install** the APK
   <br><a href="https://github.com/NightMean/ollitert/releases/latest"><img src="assets/Github/Download_Get_it_on_Github.png" alt="Get it on GitHub" height="45" /></a>
2. **Download a model** — **Gemma 4 E2B** is recommended for most devices (2.4 GB, runs on 8 GB RAM)
3. **Start the server** — Tap the Start Server button on the downloaded model card
4. **Configure your client** — Use the endpoint shown on the Status screen (e.g. `http://PHONE_IP:8000/v1`) with any OpenAI-compatible client — Open WebUI, OpenClaw, Home Assistant, Python, etc. See **[Client Setup](docs/CLIENT_SETUP.md)** for detailed guides.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires: Android 12+ · **arm64-v8a** device · 6 GB RAM minimum · 8 GB+ recommended for multimodal models (see [model table](#available-models))

## Available Models

⭐ Recommended — E2B for most devices, E4B for high-end

> [!NOTE]
> Tool calling is experimental and may not always be reliable due to model limitations.

## Limitations

<details>
<summary><strong>Known limitations — click to expand</strong></summary>

- **arm64-v8a only** — other architectures (armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64) are not supported. The LiteRT runtime ships native libraries for x86_64 but they crash on Android emulators due to unsupported CPU instructions. Nearly all Android devices from 2017+ are arm64-v8a.
- **Single model, single request** — one model loaded at a time, requests queue sequentially (LiteRT SDK limitation). On-demand model loading via client requests is planned for a future release.
- **Tool calling is experimental** — Full native tool calling in the LiteRT SDK is currently broken, so OlliteRT uses schema injection (tool schemas injected into the model's context via the SDK) for structured output. A prompt-based fallback is available if schema injection doesn't work with your model. Results may vary — works best with Gemma 4 models.
- **Token counts are estimated** — the LiteRT runtime doesn't expose a tokenizer API, so counts are approximated using character length ÷ 4. Reasonably accurate for English text, less so for code or multilingual content.
- **Imported models are copied to app storage** — when importing a model from your device, the file is copied rather than moved. You can delete the original after import to reclaim space.
- **No GGUF support** — only `.litertlm` models are supported (LiteRT runtime limitation). Models are available from the [LiteRT Community on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/litert-community). Advanced users can convert HuggingFace models to `.litertlm` using Google's [`litert-torch`](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/litert-torch) tooling (Linux, 32GB+ RAM required).
- **LiteRT runtime constraints** — OlliteRT is built on Google's [LiteRT-LM](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM) runtime, optimized for mobile. Features like logprobs, grammar-based output constraints, repetition penalties, and LoRA adapters are not available.
