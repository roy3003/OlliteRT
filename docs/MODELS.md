All models are downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/litert-community) in `.litertlm` format and run on-device via Google's [LiteRT-LM](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM) runtime.

## Which Model Should I Pick?

**Start with Gemma 4 E2B.** It's the best balance of quality, speed, and capability — multimodal (vision + audio), tool calling (experimental), thinking mode, and a 32K context window.

| Your Use Case | Recommended Model | Why |
|:--------------|:------------------|:----|
| Chat UI (e.g. Open WebUI) | Gemma 4 E2B or E4B | Best conversational quality, thinking mode for complex questions |
| Image/audio analysis | Gemma 4 E2B or Gemma 3n E2B | Both support vision and audio input |
| Low-RAM device (6 GB) | Gemma 3 1B or Qwen 2.5 1.5B | Only text-capable models fit in 6 GB |
| Fastest possible responses | Gemma 3 1B | Smallest model, lowest latency |
| Longer conversations | Gemma 4 E2B/E4B | 32K context vs 1K–4K on smaller models |
| Reasoning tasks | Gemma 4 E2B or Gemma 4 E4B | Both support chain-of-thought reasoning |

## Capabilities Explained

| Capability | What It Means |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| **Text** | Standard text chat and completions |
| **Vision** | Send images in API requests — the model can describe, analyze, and answer questions about them |
| **Audio** | Send audio in API requests — the model can transcribe and respond via text to spoken content |
| **Thinking** | Chain-of-thought reasoning mode — the model shows its reasoning process before answering (toggle per model in inference settings) |
| **Tools** | **Experimental.** Function/tool calling via SDK schema injection (default) or prompt-based fallback. With schema injection enabled, tool schemas are registered directly with the LiteRT SDK for structured output. Best with Gemma 4 models, smaller models may not follow tool instructions reliably. See [Troubleshooting → Tool Calling](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#tool-calling-experimental) for tips |
| **MTP** | Multi-Token Prediction (speculative decoding) — the model predicts multiple tokens at once for faster decode speed without quality loss. Requires a model file that includes an MTP draft head. Toggle per model in inference settings. See [FAQ → What is speculative decoding?](FAQ.md#what-is-speculative-decoding--mtp) |

## RAM Requirements

The "Min RAM" column refers to your device's total RAM, not available RAM. These values come from Google's official model specifications in the [LiteRT community](https://huggingface.co/litert-community) model cards.

> [!NOTE]
> The model file is loaded into memory alongside the Android OS and other apps. A device with exactly the minimum RAM may experience slow performance or out-of-memory (OOM) kills — Android forcefully closing apps to free RAM. See [Troubleshooting → Server crashes](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#the-server-crashes--stops-unexpectedly) if this happens.

In practice:
- 8 GB+ is recommended for a smooth experience with most models
- 12 GB+ is recommended for Gemma 4 E4B and Gemma 3n E4B

## Context Window

The context window determines how much conversation history the model can "see" at once.

| Context | Roughly Equivalent To |
|--------:|:----------------------|
| 1K | ~750 words — a few message exchanges |
| 4K | ~3,000 words — a medium conversation |
| 32K | ~24,000 words — a long conversation or very long message |

> [!NOTE]
> The word counts in the table above are approximate, based on ~0.75 words per token. Actual numbers vary depending on language, content type, and vocabulary — code and non-English text typically use more tokens per word.

When a conversation exceeds the context window, OlliteRT can automatically compact older messages to fit. Three compaction strategies are available in Settings → Context Management (all disabled by default). See the [FAQ](FAQ.md#what-is-prompt-compaction) for details, or [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#long-conversations-fail--context-window-exceeded) if conversations are failing.

## Importing Your Own Models

OlliteRT supports three ways to import models. Tap the **+** button on the Models screen to see the options:

**From a local `.litertlm` file:**
- Select a `.litertlm` model file from your device storage

**From a model list file (`.json`):**
- Select a JSON file from your device that follows the [Model Allowlist Schema](MODEL_ALLOWLIST_SCHEMA.md) — all models in the list are added to your Models screen in one go

**From a model list URL (`.json`):**
- Enter a URL pointing to a JSON model list (e.g. a raw GitHub link) — fetches the list and adds all models

> [!TIP]
> The JSON file and URL imports are one-time operations — models are added but the source is not tracked. For ongoing access to a third-party model source with automatic refresh and update detection, [add it as a model source](#model-sources) instead.

### Import Dialog

When importing a `.litertlm` file, the import dialog lets you configure the model before adding it:

- **Name** — editable model name (file extension is preserved automatically). If the name conflicts with an existing imported model, you're prompted to replace it. Names that conflict with built-in models are rejected
- **Capabilities** — toggle vision, audio, thinking, and tools support. These tell OlliteRT what to advertise — the model itself must actually support the capability
- **Max tokens** — configure the maximum output length
- **Context window** — set the model's context window size

You can also edit all of these settings after import via the model's inference settings (tap the gear icon on the model card).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Only `.litertlm` format is supported — **GGUF files cannot be used** (LiteRT runtime limitation)
> - Imported models are copied to app storage (Android scoped storage requirement), so the file will temporarily use double the disk space
>
> If import fails, see [Troubleshooting → Model import fails](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#model-import-fails).

## Model Sources

OlliteRT uses a model source system for managing where models come from — similar to how F-Droid manages app repositories. Each model source is a JSON URL that provides a list of models available for download.

### Built-in Source

The **Official** model source is included by default and points to the [LiteRT community](https://huggingface.co/litert-community) models on HuggingFace. It cannot be removed.

### Custom Model Sources

You can add custom model sources to make additional models available:

1. Go to **Settings → Model Sources**
2. Tap the **+** button
3. Choose how to add the source:
   - **From a model list file** — select a local JSON file from your device
   - **From a URL** — enter the URL of a model list JSON file (e.g. a raw GitHub link)

The JSON file must follow the [Model Allowlist Schema](MODEL_ALLOWLIST_SCHEMA.md).

Custom model sources can be enabled, disabled, or removed at any time. Disabled sources are hidden from the Models screen but their configuration is preserved.

### Incompatible Models

The Model Sources detail screen shows all models in a source, including those incompatible with your device (shown greyed out with the reason, e.g. "Requires app version X.Y.Z"). The source list shows the count as "N models · M hidden" when some models are filtered out.

### Automatic Refresh

Model sources are automatically refreshed approximately every 24 hours in the background to check for new models and updates. You can also pull-to-refresh on the Models screen to trigger an immediate refresh.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to create your own model source, see the [Model Allowlist Schema](MODEL_ALLOWLIST_SCHEMA.md) for the JSON format.

## Model Updates

OlliteRT can detect when a newer version of a downloaded model is available in a model source:

- A background worker periodically checks each enabled model source for updated model files
- When an update is found, a notification is shown and the model card displays an update indicator
- The `/v1/models` API response includes an `update_available` field per model
- To update, download the new version — it replaces the existing model file

## Model Storage

Models are stored in the app's private storage directory. You can manage them from the Models screen:

- **Download** — one-tap download from HuggingFace (or from custom model sources)
- **Delete** — removes the model file and frees storage
- **Storage indicator** — the bottom bar shows available vs used storage

## SDK Compatibility

The LiteRT SDK version bundled with OlliteRT determines which models can run. Some newer models may require an app update even if they appear in a model source. See [SDK Compatibility](SDK_COMPATIBILITY.md) for the full compatibility table.
